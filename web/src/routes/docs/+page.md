# Viber Documentation

Welcome to the Viber documentation. Viber is an agent framework for vibe-working - enabling AI agents to collaborate and work autonomously.

## What is Viber?

Viber is a framework for building and deploying AI agents that can:

- **Work Autonomously** - Agents can break down goals into tasks and execute them independently
- **Collaborate** - Multiple agents can work together on complex projects
- **Use Tools** - Agents have access to file operations, web search, browser automation, and more
- **Persist State** - Spaces maintain context and artifacts across sessions

## Architecture Overview

Viber consists of several key components:

2. **Spaces** - Workspaces that contain tasks, artifacts, and context
3. **Tools** - Capabilities that agents can use (file ops, search, etc.)
4. **Channels** - Communication interfaces (web, DingTalk, WeCom)
