# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** February 13, 2026

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using OpenViber (the "Service"), provided by Dustland ("we," "us," or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

OpenViber is an open-source, local-first AI agent platform that runs on your machine. The Service includes the OpenViber CLI, daemon, web dashboard (the "Board"), and associated cloud services such as user authentication, configuration sync, and skill discovery (collectively, the "Platform").

## 3. Accounts and Authentication

To access certain features of the Platform, you may need to sign in using a third-party account (e.g., GitHub). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. You agree not to share your account with others or allow unauthorized access.

## 4. Open Source License

The OpenViber software is released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Your use of the source code is governed by that license. These Terms govern your use of the hosted Platform services, which are separate from the open-source license.

## 5. User Responsibilities

You agree to:

- Use the Service in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
- Not use the Service to engage in any illegal, harmful, or abusive activities.
- Not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems.
- Not use the Service to distribute malware, spam, or other harmful content.
- Provide your own API keys for third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI) and comply with their respective terms of service.

## 6. Local-First Architecture

OpenViber is designed to run primarily on your local machine. Your AI agents, files, API keys, and data remain on your device unless you explicitly configure cloud integrations. We do not have access to your local data, API keys, or agent outputs unless you choose to transmit them through our cloud services.

## 7. Third-Party Services

The Service may integrate with third-party services including but not limited to GitHub, Google, OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepSeek. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or practices of any third-party services.

## 8. Intellectual Property

Content you create using OpenViber belongs to you. We claim no ownership over your prompts, agent outputs, or any work product generated through the Service. The OpenViber name, logo, and branding are trademarks of Dustland.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. AI-generated outputs may contain errors, inaccuracies, or biases — you are responsible for reviewing and validating all agent outputs before use.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Dustland shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising from your use of the Service.

## 11. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform at any time, with or without cause. You may stop using the Service at any time. Since OpenViber runs locally, you retain full access to the open-source software regardless of account status.

## 12. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of material changes by updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 13. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Dustland operates, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 14. Contact

If you have questions about these Terms, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dustland/openviber) or contact us at the channels listed there.
