# OpenViber Documentation

Welcome to the OpenViber documentation. OpenViber is an open-source platform that turns your machine into a local AI runtime — hosting role-scoped AI workers called **vibers** that handle real tasks autonomously.

## What is OpenViber?

OpenViber is a platform for deploying AI vibers that can:

- **Work Autonomously** — Vibers break down goals into tasks and execute them independently
- **Use Tools** — File operations, web search, browser automation, terminal, and more
- **Run Locally** — Full privacy, no cloud dependency, your machine is the runtime
- **Stay Scheduled** — Cron-like jobs run while you sleep

## Quick Links

- [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) — Run your first viber in minutes
- [Onboarding](/docs/getting-started/onboarding) — Set up your local runtime
- [Vibers](/docs/concepts/viber) — Configure viber behavior
- [Jobs](/docs/concepts/jobs) — Set up scheduled tasks
- [Tools](/docs/concepts/tools) — Available actions
- [Skills](/docs/concepts/skills) — Add domain knowledge

## Key Components

1. **Vibers** — Role-scoped AI workers with their own persona, tools, and memory
2. **Runtime** — Your machine running OpenViber, hosting one or more vibers
3. **Tools** — Capabilities vibers can use (file, search, browser, terminal, etc.)
4. **Skills** — Domain knowledge injected as instructions
5. **Jobs** — Scheduled tasks defined in YAML
