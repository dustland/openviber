# Design Docs Reorg

This page tracks which design docs are aligned with the current OpenViber direction (workspace-first, openclaw-alike, viber-as-subordinate model).

## Rewritten now

- `design/philosophy.md`
- `design/arch.md`
- `design/viber-daemon.md`
- `design/task-lifecycle.md`
- `design/channels.md`
- `design/communication.md`
- `design/tmux-coding-scenario.md`
- `design/viber-vs-clawdbot.md`

## Updated recently and kept

- `design/plan-and-artifacts.md`
- `design/memory.md`

## Keep for now (mostly structural/neutral)

- `design/package-structure.md`
- `design/security.md`

## Needs rewrite next

- `design/desktop-tools.md` (should clarify VNC-vs-chat intervention policy)
- `design/tool-execution.md` (should add budget-aware routing and evidence requirements)
- `design/message-parts.md` (should align with current runtime events and report schema)
- `design/skills.md` (should emphasize subordinate workflows and manager feedback ergonomics)

## Deprecated track

- Tutorials are deprecated and hidden from docs navigation.
- Legacy tutorial content remains only for historical reference.
