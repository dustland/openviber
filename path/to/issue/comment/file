Implemented fix for issue #37 by improving assistant response polling cadence in the web chat UI.

### ✅ What changed
- Reduced task progress polling interval from **1200ms** to **250ms** for much more responsive incremental updates.
- Kept the same total timeout window by deriving max poll attempts from a fixed 120s budget.

### Result
Users now see partial assistant output update much closer to real-time instead of appearing in large delayed chunks.
