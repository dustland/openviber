# OpenViber vs OpenClaw

OpenViber is intentionally **openclaw-alike** in direction: local workspace ownership, durable context, and practical operator workflows.

## Shared ground

- local-first context directories (`~/.openviber`, `~/.openclaw` style),
- skills/instructions driven workflows,
- emphasis on real tool execution over pure prompt-only chat.

## OpenViber emphasis

- unit of deployment is a **viber** (subordinate companion on one machine),
- explicit manager/subordinate contract and periodic reporting,
- terminal-first observability (tmux) with chat-first intervention,
- budget-aware execution as first-class runtime constraint,
- human-perspective verification with evidence required.

## OpenClaw emphasis (general)

- strong baseline for local assistant runtime and workspace conventions,
- robust practical patterns for coding and automation workflows.

## Practical takeaway

OpenViber should remain compatible in spirit with OpenClaw patterns while specializing in:

1. subordinate-style autonomy,
2. reporting discipline,
3. intervention ergonomics,
4. evidence-based acceptance.
