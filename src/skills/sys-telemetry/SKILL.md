# Sys Telemetry Skill

This is a compatibility alias for `system-info`.

Use this skill when you need machine telemetry from the local host:
- CPU usage and core stats
- Memory usage
- Disk capacity and free space
- Top processes by CPU/memory
- Network interfaces and optional DNS connectivity check

## Tools

This skill exposes the same tools as `system-info`:
- `system_info`
- `system_processes`
- `system_network`
